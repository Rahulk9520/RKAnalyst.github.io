My name is Rahul Kumar, and I have recently graduated from Deakin University with a degree in Applied Artificial Intelligence (Professional). I have always had a strong interest in data and how it can be used to drive business decisions and improve operations. This led me to take various courses in statistics, programming, and data analysis, which have provided me with a solid foundation in data analysis and visualization.

In my previous internships, I have worked on projects that involved data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and creating visualizations to communicate insights to stakeholders. I have also gained experience in using tools such as R, Python, and SQL to perform data analysis and develop predictive models.

I am excited about this opportunity to work as a data analyst and contribute to an organization's data-driven decision making. I am eager to apply my skills and continue to learn and grow in this field.
